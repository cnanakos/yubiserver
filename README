yubiserver
----------

This is a simple and lightweight yubikey validation
server written in C that utilizes as it's backend the
SQLITE3 database with a very powerful administration tool,
yubiserver-admin.

For the moment it lacks a configuration file but you can pass
any change from the arguments. Please check yubiserver --help and
yubiserver-admin --help.
