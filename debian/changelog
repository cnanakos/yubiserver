yubiserver (0.5-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix debian/yubiserver.postint chown/chmod errors. After
    renaming yubiserver.sqlite db file to yubiserver.sqlite.init
    and removing the installation of the db file to /var/lib/yubiserver
    directory until the first initialization, chmod and chown failed
    due to the missing db file.

yubiserver (0.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Refactor code and various cleanups.
  * Rename yubiserver.sqlite db file to yubiserver.sqlite.init and
    make a copy under /etc/yubiserver directory. For the first time
    yubiserver starts, check if yubiserver.sqlite db file exists
    under the predefined directory, if not then copy it.
    That way we exclude the database file when generating md5sums file
    for the package. (Closes: Bug#760715)
  * Update debian/watch file to use signed upstream tarballs.

        - Split purge operation to handle the removal of yubiserver user
          and clean /var/log/yubiserver and /var/run/yubiserver dir's.

          directory.

    Thanks to Apollon Oikonomopoulos <apoikos@gmail.com> for pointing 
    this out.
  * yubiserver now drops privileges and runs as the new added user 
    'yubiserver'.
    With changes above a new system user/group 'yubiserver' is created and
    the appropriate permissions to the database and the yubiserver-admin binary
    are set. The database file is group-writable by this group, allowing 
    the local administrator to grant yubiserver-admin access to regular users.
